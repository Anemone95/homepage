abstract: In the open source community such as GitHub, developers usually need to
  find projects similar to their work, with the aim to reuse their functions and explore
  ideas of features that could be possibly added into their project at hand. Traditional
  text search engine can help detect similar resources. However, it is difficult for
  developers to use in open source community because a few query words cannot describe
  the whole features of a project. In this paper, we present a practical software
  recommendation system, REPERSP, which is used to recommend personalized software
  projects in GitHub. According to the features of projects created by developers
  and their behavior to other known projects, REPERSP recommends the top N relevant
  and personalized software projects. Moreover, REPERSP is implemented with the MapReduce
  parallel processing frame â€“ Apache Spark for large-scale data, which can be scaled
  to a large number of users and projects for practical usage. Empirical results show
  that REPERSP can recommend more accurate results compared with other two recommendation
  algorithms, i.e., UserCF (user collaborative filtering) and ItemCF (item collaborative
  filtering). Video of our demo is available at https://youtu.be/WKigSUV4UA0.
