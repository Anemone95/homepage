abstract: GitHub, one of the largest social coding platforms, fosters a flexible and
  collaborative development process. In practice, developers in the open source software
  platform need to find projects relevant to their development work to reuse their
  function, explore ideas of possible features, or analyze the requirements for their
  projects. Recommending relevant projects to a developer is a difficult problem considering
  that there are millions of projects hosted on GitHub, and different developers may
  have different requirements on relevant projects. In this paper, we propose a scalable
  and personalized approach to recommend projects by leveraging both developers' behaviors
  and project features. Based on the features of projects created by developers and
  their behaviors to other projects, our approach automatically recommends top N most
  relevant software projects to developers. Moreover, to improve the scalability of
  our approach, we implement our approach in a parallel processing frame (i.e., Apache
  Spark) to analyze large-scale data on GitHub for efficient recommendation. We perform
  an empirical study on the data crawled from GitHub, and the results show that our
  approach can efficiently recommend relevant software projects with a relatively
  high precision fit for developers' interests.
