abstract: GitHub is a software development platform that facilitates collaboration
  and participation in project development. Typically, developers search for relevant
  projects in order to reuse functions and identify useful features. Recommending
  suitable projects for developers can save their time. However, finding suitable
  projects among many projects on GitHub is difficult. In addition, different users
  may have different requirements. A recommendation system would help developers by
  reducing the time required to find suitable projects. In this paper, we propose
  an approach to recommend projects that considers developer behaviors and project
  features. The proposed approach automatically recommends the top-N most relevant
  software projects. We also integrate user feedback to improve recommendation accuracy.
  The results of an empirical study using data crawled from GitHub demonstrate that
  the proposed approach can efficiently recommend relevant software projects with
  relatively high precision.
